## a plugin container as well.

## the "prefer-parent-resources" plugin does what it sounds like: it prefers to mount configmaps/secrets
## from the "parent" cluster (meaning *not* the vcluster). this is a super simple plugin, you could
## obviously get way more advanced! let's see where this "parent" resource is coming from:
p "kubectl get secrets -n my-vcluster-2 my-secret -o jsonpath='{.data.data}' | base64 -d"
KUBECONFIG=kubeconfigs/vcluster-0-ha kubectl get secrets -n my-vcluster-2 my-secret -o jsonpath='{.data.data}' | base64 -d

## and we can check the logs of the plugin just like any other pod and see what its doin... obviously
## this will be entirely up to the plugin what they log and such, but the point here is its just
## a normal container doin' normal things more or less! in this case we can see where we mutate a pod
## to prefer the configmap from the "real" host.
